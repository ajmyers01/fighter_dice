# Synopsis 

- During their trip through the Sunless Citadel, characters deal with monstrous threats and ancient traps, 
as well as warring tribes of kobolds and goblins.
The adventure is designed for four 1st-level characters they should advance through 2nd level to 3rd level before the finale.

1. Oakhurst
  - Although it isn't part of the adventure per se, the village of Oakhurst can provide the characters with valuable information
  about the citadel. They can also use Oakhurst as a place to recuperate and replenish supplies
2. Kobold Den
  - The characters' foray into the citadel begins with an incursion into the most accesible areas of the fortress,
  where a tribe of kobolds has taken up residence. The characters can avoid strife with the kobolds by agreeing to retrieve a lost pet for the kobold leader
  they may be able to persude the kobolds to join their side.
3. Goblin Lair. 
  - The goblins that live deeper inside the citadel consider themselves the owners of the place. They defend themselves
  aggressively against intrusion, making it difficult to avoid combat with them.
4. Hidden Grove
  - Eventually the characters discover the lower level of the citadel and the Twilight Grove that lies within. There they 
  learn the truth about the enchanted fruit, and they must confront Belak the Outcast and the Gulthias Tree.
  
## Secondary Hook
 - Rescue Mission 
   - Another party of adventurers, locally based, delved into the Sunless Citadel a month past. They were never seen again.
   Two human members of that ill-fated party were brother and sister. Talgen Hucrele( a fighter) and Sharwyn Hucrele ( a wizard).
   They were part of an important merchant family. Kerowyn Hucrele, the matriarch of the family, offers salvage rights to you and your team if you can find
   and return the gold signet rings worn by the missing brother and sister. She also offers 125 gp per ring per character. If they
   bring them back in good shape she will double the reward.
