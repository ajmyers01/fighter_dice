Your exposure to the Feywild's magic has changed you, granting you the following benefits:
-   Increase your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
-   You learn the [Misty Step](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spell:misty-step) spell and one 1st-level spell of your choice. The 1st-level spell must be from the [Divination](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:divination) or [Enchantment](http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells:enchantment) school of magic. You can cast each of these spells without expending a spell slot. Once you cast either of these spells in this way, you can’t cast that spell in this way again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast these spells using spell slots you have of the appropriate level. The spells’ spellcasting ability is the ability increased by this feat.



Chosen Spell: Silvery Barbs

## Silvery Barbs : 

**Source**: Strixhaven: A Curriculum of Chaos
1st-level Enchantment
**Casting Time**: 1 reaction, which you take when a creature you can see within 60 feet of yourself succeeds on an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw
**Range**: 60 feet
**Components**: V
**Duration**: Instantaneous

You magically distract the triggering creature and turn its momentary uncertainty into encouragement for another creature. The triggering creature must reroll the d20 and use the lower roll.

You can then choose a different creature you can see within range (you can choose yourself). The chosen creature has advantage on the next attack roll, ability check, or saving throw it makes within 1 minute. A creature can be empowered by only one use of this spell at a time.
