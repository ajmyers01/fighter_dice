You belonged to the Vanrakdoom cult, located deep in Undermountain. It was founded by the desgraced Lord Vanrak Moonstar, a Waterdhavian noble who fell from grace and rose as a death knight - before committing suicide in the year 1436 DR. Vanrak's faithful friend and companian, Umbraxakar the shadow dragon, still remains in Vanrakdoom



The cult worshiped Shar, god of darkness and loss. The cult's leader when you were there was a vampire cleric by the name of Keresta Devingstone. The cult's symbol is a black circle with a purple ring:

Core tenents of Shar faith:
In darkness, act. Never wait for the darkness to pass before making your move.
Quench the light of the moon when you can. Hide from it when you can't. (edited) 
Keep secrets from all except Shar's faithful.
Only a fool believes in hope
