### Previous life

Poor street performer, wonderfully gifted at the harp, with the voice of an angel. She however found that her talents werent' being recognized and had to resign herself to working in a seamstress factory making war garments for the young soldiers. Later found that the exposure to the fumes of the dye has caused terrible damage to her lungs, which causes her much fatigue if overexerted.
